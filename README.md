# TuneDownForWhat
Guitar tuner / frequency generator app  
Simple design that allows guided tuning as well as tuning by ear with frequency generator for each string

Notes:  
*TUNER SECTION INCOMPLETE*  
Pitches produced by frequency generator challenge the frequency output range of mobile devices, even after being transposed up an octave
