# TuneDownForWhat
Guitar tuner / frequency generator app
Simple design that allows guided tuning as well as tuning by ear with frequency generator for each string

Notes:
*TUNER SECTION INCOMPLETE*
Pitches produced by frequency generator challenge the frequency output range of mobile devices, even after being transposed up an octave.
What can I say, it felt like a good idea at the time.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
